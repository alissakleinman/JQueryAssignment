//JQuery cheatsheet

// In the html file, I called this script library. Here's a function that I'll call in the html.
function alertName (somename){
	return alert(somename);
}
//It works!

//I also called the script library JQuery in my html.

//To call JQuery functions, you use the dollar sign. I called the following in the console:

//$(".cowgirl").slideUp()

//And the image slid up!

//Of use in the html document is an anonymouse function on line 27. $(document).ready () ensures that the functions that follow it aren't loaded until the page is ready.
