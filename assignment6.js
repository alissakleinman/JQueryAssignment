//JQuery cheatsheet

// In the html file, I called this script library. Here's a function that I'll call in the html.
function alertName (somename){
	return alert(somename);
}
//It works!

//I also called the script library JQuery in my html.

//To call JQuery functions, you use the dollar sign. I called the following in the console:

$(".cowgirl").hide;
